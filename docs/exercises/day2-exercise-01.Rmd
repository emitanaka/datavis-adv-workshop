### Exercise 1.1: Interactive scatterplot

Make a scatterplot of `flipper length` by `body_mass_g` coloured by the three `species` of penguins. Add a tooltip that labels the points by variable values and the species.


```{r part2-exercise-01-01, echo = F, class = "target"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/day2-exercise-01/day2-exercise-01-1.png")
```

```{r part2-exercise-01-01s}
# add your code here!
```

### Exercise 1.2: Interactive histogram

Make a histogram of `flipper_length_mm` facetted by `species` and sex`, paying attention to remove the missing values. Add a tooltip that contains the count, flipper length of minimum of the bin. 

```{r part2-exercise-01-02, echo = F, class = "target"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/day2-exercise-01/day2-exercise-01-2.png")
```

```{r part2-exercise-01-02s}
# add your code here!
```

### Exercise 1.3: Scatterplot matrix

Make a scatterplot matrix of four variables for the Gentoo penguins, coloured by sex. Pay attention to removing missing values. 

```{r part2-exercise-01-03, echo = F, class = "target"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/day2-exercise-01/day2-exercise-01-3.png")
```

```{r part2-exercise-01-03s}
# add your code here!
```
